Mastering the Swap: Converting $UM to ZEC via Osmosis, Prax, and Keplr

In the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance, seamless token swapping across privacy networks is becoming increasingly crucial. Whether you’re securing your gains, diversifying your portfolio, or simply exploring what’s possible across blockchains, knowing how to convert assets from one network to another is vital.

This professional guide walks you step-by-step through the process of swapping Penumbra’s $UM token into ZEC (Zcash) using Prax, Osmosis, and Keplr. Each step is carefully detailed to ensure clarity and security throughout your journey.

What You’ll Need

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

Prax App (connected to Penumbra)

Keplr Wallet (for Osmosis and Zcash network interaction)

Osmosis Interface (https://app.osmosis.zone)

A small amount of gas tokens (ATOM or similar) in Keplr

An internet-connected device with your wallet and apps ready

Step 1: Launch Prax and Check Your $UM Balance

Open the Prax application on your device. Ensure that it is correctly synced with the Penumbra network.

Navigate to your wallet dashboard.

Confirm your $UM token balance.

Make sure the wallet is active and connected.


> Tip: It’s a good practice to double-check that you’re using the latest version of the Prax app.

Step 2: Initiate an IBC Transfer from Prax to Osmosis

Since Osmosis operates on the Cosmos ecosystem and Penumbra is IBC-compatible, you can transfer your $UM via IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication).

From the Prax dashboard, find the "Send" or "Transfer via IBC" button.

Choose Osmosis as your destination chain.

Paste your Keplr Osmosis address (which you can copy from the Keplr browser extension).

Select the amount of $UM to transfer.

Confirm and approve the transaction.


Wait a few minutes for the IBC transfer to complete. You can monitor transaction status using Osmosis block explorers like Mintscan.
Step 3: Confirm $UM Receipt on Osmosis via Keplr

Once the IBC transfer is complete, open the Keplr wallet:

Switch the chain view to Osmosis.

Navigate to the Assets tab.

You should see $UM (likely listed under “Unknown Token” if unrecognized by Keplr yet).


If the token doesn’t show up automatically:

Manually add $UM by entering the token’s IBC hash.

Or check Osmosis app to see if the token is reflected there.

Step 4: Swap $UM for ATOM or a Common Token on Osmosis

Osmosis doesn’t have direct liquidity pools for every asset. So first, convert $UM to a more liquid asset like ATOM or USDC.

Go to https://app.osmosis.zone

Click on “Swap”.

Select $UM in the "From" field and ATOM/USDC in the "To" field.

Choose a reasonable slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5%).

Click “Swap”, then approve the transaction via Keplr.


> Pro Tip: Always review the pool details and swap preview for pricing and fees before confirming.
Step 5: Swap ATOM/USDC to ZEC on Osmosis

Now that you have ATOM or USDC, the final step on Osmosis is converting it to ZEC:

Return to the Swap tab.

Select ATOM/USDC as the source.

Choose ZEC as the target asset.

Input the amount and initiate the swap.

Approve the transaction in Keplr.

Step 6: Withdraw ZEC to Your Zcash Wallet (Optional)
If your goal is to hold ZEC natively or send it elsewhere:

Head to the Assets page in Osmosis.

Find ZEC in your asset list.

Click “Withdraw”.

Choose Zcash (native chain) or another IBC-compatible network if supported.

Enter your ZEC wallet address (shielded or transparent).

Confirm withdrawal and approve in Keplr.
Tips for a Safe and Smooth Experience

Stay Updated: Always ensure Prax, Keplr, and Osmosis are updated to the latest versions.

Gas Tokens: Keep a few ATOM in your wallet to pay for Osmosis transactions.

Network Check: Make sure all networks (Penumbra, Osmosis, Zcash) are fully synced.

Test First: For large swaps, try with a small amount first to verify the flow.

Watch Fees and Slippage: Minor variations can impact your total value received, especially for low-liquidity tokens.
By following the steps outlined above, you’ve successfully moved assets across one of the most innovative privacy-preserving networks (Penumbra) into one of the strongest privacy-focused cryptocurrencies (ZEC). This process not only shows the power of IBC but also illustrates how decentralized apps like Prax, Keplr, and Osmosis are reshaping asset portability.

In a world demanding both financial transparency and privacy, mastering cross-chain token swaps positions you at the forefront of digital finance.
